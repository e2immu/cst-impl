== Expression creation and evaluation

`Sum`, `Product`, `Equals`, `Negation`, etc.

The user uses the `Runtime` interface to

- create an object, using a `newSum` operation; this is in the `Factory` interface
- create the optimal object, using a `sum` operation; this is in the `Eval` interface


Evaluation classes such as `EvalSum` can be overridden by more performant versions.
